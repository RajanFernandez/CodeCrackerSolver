# CodeCrackerSolver

Code cracker is a crossword style puzzle game that is often printed in the newspaper. To play the game, words in the puzzle must be identified sequentially in order to identify the puzzle code: a table where each letter in the alphabet has a corresponding number in the range of 1-26. Sometimes the first word in the puzzle is difficult to guess and hence blocks the player from enjoying the rest of the puzzle. This app allows players to get a little help in solving those tricker words.
